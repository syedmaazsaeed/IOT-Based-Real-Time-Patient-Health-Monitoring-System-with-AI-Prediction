# IOT-Based-Real-Time-Patient-Health-Monitoring-System

Welcome to the IoT-Based Real-Time Patient Health Monitoring System! This system uses IoT technology to continuously monitor vital health parameters such as body temperature, ECG, heart rate, and pulse rate. The collected data is then transmitted to the cloud for analysis and easy monitoring. 🏥🌐

An advanced IoT-powered system that tracks heart rate ❤️, temperature 🌡, SpO2 ⏳, and ECG in real-time. 🚨 Alerts doctors instantly in emergencies, stores data securely in the cloud ☁, and provides remote patient monitoring 📊📱. Revolutionizing healthcare with AI-driven insights! ⭐

## **1. Project Overview 🚀**

This health monitoring system is designed to provide real-time monitoring of patients' key health metrics. Using MAX30100 (for pulse oximetry), DS18B20 (for temperature), and an ECG sensor, the system ensures continuous tracking of a patient's heart rate, oxygen saturation, body temperature, and ECG readings. Alerts are triggered if any of the values go out of the safe range. 🚑

## **2. Key Features**

### **2.1 Real-Time Data Monitoring** : Track key health parameters like temperature, heart rate, SpO2, and ECG. 💓📈
### **2.2 Abnormal Condition Alerts** :  Get immediate alerts (LED/Buzzer) when any vital sign goes outside normal limits. 🚨
### **2.3 Cloud Integration** :  Seamless data transmission to Ubidots for real-time cloud monitoring. 🌐
### **2.4 LCD Display** :  A real-time LCD display for quick health data visualization. 🖥️
### **2.5 Easy Wi-Fi Connectivity**:  Connects easily to Wi-Fi for cloud communication. 📡

## **3. Tech Stack**

- **DS18B20**: For body temperature measurement.  
- **ECG Sensor**: For capturing ECG data.  
- **ESP8266**: For Wi-Fi connectivity.  
- **LCD Display**: For displaying live data.

### **3.2 Software**

- **Arduino IDE** for writing the firmware.  
- **Ubidots** for cloud integration.

### **3.3 Libraries**

- Wire.h  
- LiquidCrystal_I2C.h  
- ESP8266WiFi.h  
- Ubidots.h  
- MAX30100_PulseOximeter.h  
- DallasTemperature.h  
- OneWire.h.

## **4. How It Works**

### **4.1 Sensor Data Collection**

The system collects data from **MAX30100** (heart rate, SpO2), **DS18B20** (temperature), and **ECG sensor**.

### **4.2 Data Analysis**

The health metrics are continuously monitored for any abnormal readings.

### **4.3 Alert Mechanism**

If abnormal conditions are detected (e.g., high temperature, low oxygen levels, irregular heart rate), the system activates a red LED and buzzer for alerting. 🆘
If the system detects abnormal conditions like high temperature, low oxygen levels, or irregular heart rate, it activates a red LED for a visual alert and triggers a buzzer for an audible warning.
This ensures immediate attention and helps in early detection of potential health risks, allowing for quick action. 🚨

### **4.4 Cloud Transmission**

Every 16 seconds, the data is sent to **Ubidots** for storage and further analysis.

### **4.5 LCD Visualization**

The real-time readings are displayed on the LCD for quick checks. 🖥️
